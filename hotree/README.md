# Hotree

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

Setup project - using git:
1. Clone repository: https://github.com/andziaoo7/hotree.git
2. Go into created folder, click to another one hotree folder, than open your terminal (or you can do it directly from terminal) and type 'npm install'
3. After packages were installed you can type 'ng serve' to run application. 
4. Navigate to localhost:4200
5. You can now check my work :)

Setup project - using zipped repository:
1. Extract files and go into first hotree folder
2. Open here your terminal and run 'npm install'
3. Follow steps 3-5 from 'Setup project - using git' instruction.

P.S. I'm sorry for my CSS/SASS skills.
